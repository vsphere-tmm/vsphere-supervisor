# Introduction

This document captures the troubleshooting resources for the VKS cluster (workload cluster formally known as TKGs cluster), which is part of our VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) offering. It is based on the vSphere 8.0U3 and VMware Cloud Foundation 5.2 releases, and we heavily leverage our [existing troubleshooting documents](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/7-0/vsphere-with-tanzu-configuration-and-management-7-0/troubleshooting-vsphere-with-kubernetes.html) here. Checking release-specific documentation is recommended, given that some troubleshooting approaches and commands may change in future releases.
