# Utilizing the Custom Cluster Class to personalize VKS cluster deployment
A custom ClusterClass allows you to tailor cluster configurations to fit specific needs while still leveraging the benefits of standardization. Here’s why it matters:
1. Organization-Specific Standardization:
A default ClusterClass might not fit your infrastructure, security, or networking requirements. A custom ClusterClass ensures clusters adhere to your organization’s specific policies and best practices.
2. Flexibility While Maintaining Consistency: 
Instead of using a generic template, a custom ClusterClass lets you predefine control plane and node pool customizations and networking setups while still allowing minor variations.
3. Preconfigured Security & Compliance:
You can embed security best practices directly into the ClusterClass.

The purpose of this document is to guide you through some of the ways you can leverage Custom ClusterClass. Please note that Custom ClusterClass is **not supported** by Broadcom and improper configurations/use may lead to service disruptions and/or outages. 

This document is specific to versioned ClusterClass (TKG Service 3.1.x and higher). Please refer to the official documenation for TKG Service 3.0 and lower.
